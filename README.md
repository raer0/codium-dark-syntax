## 0. Preamble

[Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/) was my favorite editor/IDE for a long time. I grew quite fond of the Atom IDE Dark Syntax theme - to the point where I dug through an old hard drive to find a copy when the author temporarily removed the repo. So, making VSCode feel like Atom was paramount for me to [accept Atom's fate](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/). With [this theme's namesake](https://vscodium.com/) I can at least take advantage of Microsoft's offering without giving them any telemetry. And with this theme and some custom keybinds... I guess I can accept VSCode into my workflow.
