## 0. Preamble

[Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/) was my favorite editor/IDE for a long time. I grew quite fond of the Atom IDE Dark Syntax theme - to the point where I dug through an old hard drive to find a copy when the author temporarily removed the repo. So, making VSCode feel like Atom was paramount for me to [accept Atom's fate](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/). With [this theme's namesake](https://vscodium.com/) I can at least take advantage of Microsoft's offering without giving them any telemetry. And with this theme and some custom keybinds... I guess I can accept VSCode into my workflow.

## 3. Special Thanks

- [The Atom project and contributors](https://github.com/atom/atom/) - for creating, working on, and maintaining a tool which I found invaluable for many years.

- [The Atom community](https://github.com/atom-community/) - for their efforts in maintaining things such as atom-ide, which was an invaluable extension to Atom.
